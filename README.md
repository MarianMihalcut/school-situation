<h2> Modifying code program to better suit the school's nesessities information: </h2>
If you wish to edit the code, you are required to copy the repository and store the content locally. <strong>You cannot use the same code and claim it's yours or write over the original code in Github without written permission.</strong><br>
Here's the following info you can change for a better suit of your necessities:<br>
- The structure field names<br>
- Any functions that relates on the structure fields(only edit their names)<br>
- Add any suplimentary output messages you want<br>
- Edit command names and arguments<br>

<h2> How to run the application </h2>
<strong>Note: you cannot just use the program by just pressing main.exe file.<br></strong>
By doing this, the .exe file will close nearly instantly, as 0 additional arguments to this command-based program will just compile the code what is written.<br>
You'll have to open the Command Prompt or the Terminal either from OS or from VS Code. If you use VS Code, make sure you use all of the .c,.h,.csv,.exe files provided before you use the program.<br>
Make sure to be with the terminal in the same directory as the .exe file before executing. Do not put the path to the executable file directly, just the path to the folder where it is.<br>
To do this, you can use the following command model:<br>
<strong>cd (full path to the folder where is the executable)</strong> 
<br>
<br>
You may consult the help menu if you have issues running commands or don't know them exactly. Run:<br>
<strong> ./main -help (*command)<br></strong>
* - optional

<br>
If you do not write commands correctly, you may not get a warning message in all of the cases. This will be fixed in a future update.
